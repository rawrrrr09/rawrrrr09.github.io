              I was born on November 2 2006 in Tangerang, Banten, Indonesia. My
              name is Alfonsius Tolan Hera, I am 16 years old, but tomorrow I
              will be 17 years old. I am interested in choosing the Software
              Engineering major because I am quite interested in technological
              developments

      gaurav programmer gaurav, Programmer Gaurav. portfolio A computer
      programmer, sometimes called more recently a coder (especially in more
      informal contexts), is a person who creates computer software. The term
      computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers, or
      to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. A programmer's
      most oft-used computer language (e.g., Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#,
      JavaScript, Lisp, Python) may be prefixed to the term programmer. Some who
      work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web.
      programmer gaurav A range of occupations that involve programming also
      often require a range of other, similar skills, for example: (software)
      developer, web developer, mobile applications developer, embedded firmware
      developer, software engineer, computer scientist, game programmer, game
      developer and software analyst. The use of the term programmer as applied
      to these positions is sometimes considered an insulting simplification or
      even derogatory. British countess and mathematician Ada Lovelace is often
      considered to be the first computer programmer, as she was the first to
      publish part of a program (specifically an algorithm) intended for
      implementation on Charles Babbage's analytical engine, in October 1842.
      The algorithm was used to calculate Bernoulli numbers.[7] Because
      Babbage's machine was never completed as a functioning standard in
      Lovelace's time, she unfortunately never had the opportunity to see the
      algorithm in action. The ENIAC programming team, consisting of Kay
      McNulty, Betty Jennings, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Wescoff, Fran Bilas and Ruth
      Lichterman were the first regularly working programmers.[8][9]
      International Programmers' Day is celebrated annually on 7 January.[10] In
      2009, the government of Russia decreed a professional annual holiday known
      as Programmers' Day to be celebrated on 13 September (12 September in leap
      years). It had already been an unofficial holiday before that in many
      countries. The word software was used as early as 1953, but did not
      regularly appear in print until the 1960s.[11] Before this time, computers
      were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer
      manufacturers of the time, such as UNIVAC and IBM. The first company
      founded to specifically provide software products and services was the
      Computer Usage Company, in 1955.[12] The software industry expanded in the
      early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in
      mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments and businesses created
      a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by
      full-time staff programmers; some were distributed freely between users of
      a particular machine for no charge. And others were developed on a
      commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation
      (founded in 1959) also started to grow. The computer/hardware
      manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems, system software and
      programming environments with their machines.[citation needed] The
      industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer ("PC") in
      the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average office worker. In
      the following years the PC also helped create a constantly-growing market
      for games, applications and utilities software. CP/M, later replaced by
      DOS, Microsoft's Windows popular operating system of the time.[13]
      portfolio programmer gaurav In the early years of the 21st century,
      another successful business model has arisen for hosted software, called
      software-as-a-service, or SaaS. From the point of view of producers of
      some proprietary software, SaaS reduces the concerns about unauthorized
      copying, since it can only be accessed through the Web, and by definition,
      no client software is loaded onto the end user's PC. SaaS is typically run
      out of the cloud. Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain
      the detailed instructions, called computer programs, that computers must
      follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and
      test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical
      innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and
      sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the
      role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today.
      Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.
      Programmers work in many settings, including corporate information
      technology ("IT") departments, big software companies, small service firms
      and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also
      work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is
      not typically required to work as a programmer, although professional
      certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely
      considered a profession (although some[who?] authorities disagree on the
      grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a
      profession). Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of
      business for which they are writing programs. For example, the
      instructions involved in updating financial records are very different
      from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots
      training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few
      hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while
      others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously
      improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers
      work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision. portfolio

      Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined
      primarily by more senior programmers and by systems analysts. After the
      design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert
      that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can
      follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming
      languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the
      purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business
      applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers,
      whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are
      widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JS
      and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business
      applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming
      language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new
      languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred
      to by the language they know, e.g. as Java programmers, or by the type of
      function they perform or environment in which they work: for example,
      database programmers, mainframe programmers, or Web developers. When
      making changes to the source code that programs are made up of,
      programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the
      routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the source
      code so that others can understand the program more easily and by
      documenting their code. To save work, programmers often use libraries of
      basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application.
      This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases
      programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps. Testing and
      debugging Programmers test a program by running it and looking for bugs
      (errors). As they are identified, the programmer usually makes the
      appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably low
      level and severity of bugs remain. This process is called testing and
      debugging. These are important parts of every programmer's job.
      Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a
      program. Updating, repairing, modifying, and expanding existing programs
      is sometimes called maintenance programming. Programmers may contribute to
      user guides and online help, or they may work with technical writers to do
      such work. Application versus system programming Computer programmers
      often are grouped into two broad types: application programmers and
      systems programmers. Application programmers write programs to handle a
      specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization.
      They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic
      applications which are frequently purchased from independent software
      vendors. Systems programmers, in contrast, write programs to maintain and
      control computer systems software, such as operating systems and database
      management systems. These workers make changes in the instructions that
      determine how the network, workstations, and CPU of the system handle the
      various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral
      equipment such as printers and disk drives. programmer gaurav Types of
      software portfolio Programmers in software development companies may work
      directly with experts from various fields to create software – either
      programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general
      use – ranging from video games to educational software to programs for
      desktop publishing and financial planning. Programming of packaged
      software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the
      computer services industry. Some companies or organizations – even small
      ones – have set up their own IT team to ensure the design and development
      of in-house software to answer to very specific needs from their internal
      end-users, especially when existing software are not suitable or too
      expensive. This is for example the case in research laboratories.[citation
      needed] In some organizations, particularly small ones, people commonly
      known as programmer analysts are responsible for both the systems analysis
      and the actual programming work. The transition from a mainframe
      environment to one that is based primarily on personal computers (PCs) has
      blurred the once rigid distinction between the programmer and the user.
      Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously
      performed by programmers. For example, the growing use of packaged
      software, such as spreadsheet and database management software packages,
      allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform
      calculations.[citation needed] programmer gaurav In addition, the rise of
      the Internet has made web development a huge part of the programming
      field. Currently more software applications are web applications that can
      be used by anyone with a web browser.[citation needed] Examples of such
      applications include the Google search service, the Outlook.com e-mail
      service, and the Flickr photo-sharing service. programmer gaurav
      Programming editors, also known as source code editors, are text editors
      that are specifically designed for programmers or developers for writing
      the source code of an application or a program. Most of these editors
      include features useful for programmers, which may include color syntax
      highlighting, auto indentation, auto-complete, bracket matching, syntax
      check, and allows plug-ins. These features aid the users during coding,
      debugging and testing.[17] portfolio programmer gaurav Programming is the
      process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to
      perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer
      "languages," such as SQL, Java, Python, and C++.
